# Grocery API

The initial repository for PyLadies Hamburg's "Introduction to FastAPI" workshop.

## Requirements

The [setup instructions](#setup) assumes you already have the following:

- Git
- Python 3.8 (if you have an existing installation of 3.9, that works too)
- The code editor you are most comfortable using

## Setup<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

1) Clone this repository  
   a) In your terminal, execute `git clone https://github.com/paxcodes/grocery_api`  
   b) Still in the terminal, change your working directory: `cd grocery_api`

2) Create the virtual environment
   * Using your python3.8 (or 3.9), run the command `[PYTHON_EXECUTABLE] -m venv --prompt "grocery_api" .venv`
   * E.g. `python3 -m venv --prompt "grocery_api" .venv`
   * âœ… A `.venv` folder will be created inside the project folder.

      ![.venv folder should be present](readme_assets/checklist_venv_folder.png)

3) Activate your virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
   * âœ… Your terminal prompt will be prefixed with `(grocery_api)` once the virtual environment is activated.
   * âœ… Running `which pip` and `which python` should output the `.venv` directory inside your `grocery_api` folder. (e.g. `/grocery_api/.venv/bin/pip` and `/grocery_api/.venv/bin/python`)
   * âœ… Running `python --version` should output 3.8/3.9. If it isn't, delete your `.venv` folder and repeat Step #3 onwards.

4) Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * âœ… It should output something like, `Successfully installed ... fastapi-0.65.2 ... uvicorn-0.14.0 ... pytest-6.2.4 ... requests-2.25.1`

5) Install the project: `pip install -e .`
   * ðŸ’¡ This will install the grocery_api package locally. This is necessary to do for `pytest` to work.
   * âœ… It should output something like, `Successfully installed grocery-api-1.0`

6) Run tests in the terminal by typing, `pytest` 
   * âœ… It should output,
      ```
      ...
      collected 24 items

      tests\test_endpoints.py .                  [  4%]
      tests\crud\test_item.py ...........        [ 50%]
      tests\crud\test_store.py ..........        [ 91%]
      tests\crud\test_user.py ..                 [100%]

      ============== 24 passed in 0.XXs ===============
      ```

7) Run the server: `uvicorn grocery_api.main:app`
   * âœ… It should say,
      ```sh
      INFO:     Application startup complete.
      INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
      ```

8) Go to your browser and visit, http://127.0.0.1:8000
   * âœ… It should say, `{ "message": "Hello World!" }`

9) Exit the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

If you have made it all the way to the end and everything is as expected (âœ…), you have successfully setup your environment and ready for the workshop!

If you are having trouble with any of the steps, reach out in PyLadies' Slack channel #city-hamburg.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: Instructions are based on MacOS but if you use Git Bash in Windows, the instructions should be fairly the same.  
<a name="myfootnote2">2</a>: In Windows, this would be `source .venv/Scripts/activate`
