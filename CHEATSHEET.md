# Quick Reference for the Workshop

## HTTP Methods

POST: to create an API resource.
GET: to read an API resource.
PUT*: to update an API resource with a complete resource representation (e.g. completely replace it).
PATCH*: to partially update an API resource (e.g. modify one of the fields)
DELETE: to delete an API resource.

* PATCH is less commonly used and known than PUT. Many teams also use PUT for partial updates.

## HTTP Status Codes

200 [Operation Succeeded] - Operation is successful
422 [Operation Failed] - Invalid Data / unprocessable entity
404 [Operation Failed] - Resource not found

## Data Helper Methods

```python
# To get all store resources
store.read_all()

# To get a specific store resource
store.read(store_id)

# To create a store resource
store.create()
```

## User ID for the Workshop

In the workshop, we'll create an endpoint for a user resource and test this endpoint. You'd need the User ID during this time.

## Python Types

These are types relevant for the workshop. They are all included in Python's standard library (based on Python 3.8).

[Built-in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html): `str`, `int`, `bool`

From the [`typing` package](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html):

- `Optional` (e.g. `Optional[str]` - an optional string; can be an instance of a string or `None`)
- `List`* (e.g. `List[Item]` - a list of `Item` instances)
- `Dict`** (e.g. `Dict[dict]` - a dictionary of dictionaries)


\* When not specifying the type of _what is in the list_, using `list` is sufficient to use for typing.  
** When not specifying the type of _keys and values in the dictionary_, using `dict` is sufficient to use for typing.

ðŸ’¡ In 3.9, `List` and `Dict` are deprecated. You can use `list` and `dict` and also specify the types of their elements / keys and values.

From other packages in the standard library: 

- `from enum import Enum` - To limit the variable to predefined values
- `from decimal import Decimal` - When precision is important (e.g. prices)

### The Syntax

```
[variable-name]: [type]
```

Examples,


```python
from typing import Optional


class Item:
    name: str
    description: Optional[str]
```

```python
async def add(num1: int, num2: int):
    return num1 + num2
```
